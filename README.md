I am creating a server in C to play around with the CJSON and OpenSSL libraries.

Update (7/28/13) Base functionality now complete.  This is a simple console-based chat server that supports multiple users with multiplexing.

Message encryption will be the next big step.

Also, TODO.txt was added which outlines the changes I wish to make to this program.
