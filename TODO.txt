==URGENT==

==QUICK==

==MEDIUM==
[Both] Create a data structure representing a normal cJSON message
[Server] Create new threads for send_to_all (sending would take too long for many concurrent users) <-- msg would need to be copied to nontemporary memory or be overwritten

==LONG==
[BOTH] Separate setup from messaging functions (break the server/client_setup libraries into two separate ones)
[Both] Set up user authentication
[Both] Instead of console-based, create a GUI
[Both] Encrypt communication for secure chat
