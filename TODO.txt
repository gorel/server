==URGENT==

==QUICK==

==MEDIUM==
[Server]	Add admin functionality (make temp admin, mute user, unmute user, kick user)
[Both]		Create a data structure representing a normal cJSON message
[Server]	Create new threads for send_to_all (sending would take too long for many concurrent users) <-- msg would need to be copied to nontemporary memory

==LONG==
[Both]		Set up user authentication
[Both]		Instead of console-based, create a GUI
[Both]		Encrypt communication for secure chat


==COMPLETED==
[Both]		Fix return values to be more descriptive
[Both]		Don't allow blank messages to be sent
[Server]	Make sure usernames are unique
[Both]		Add private messaging function (!tell <user> <private message>)
[Both]		Separate setup from messaging functions (break server/client _setup libraries into two separate ones for setup and messaging)
