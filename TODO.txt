==BUGS==
[Server]	User is kicked without seeing the reason why

==QUICK==
[Both]		Don't accept names that aren't just a single word (strtok could be helpful)

==MEDIUM==
[Server]	Allow vote-kicking a user if there is no admin present (40% of online user? 51%?  What would be a good balance?)

==LONG==
[Both]		Set up user authentication
[Both]		Instead of console-based, create a GUI
[Both]		Encrypt communication for secure chat


==COMPLETED==
[Server]	(BUG) User can potentially ignore the same user 20 times
[Both]		Create a function to create a default cJSON string from some given data
[Client]	(BUG) After a user receives a "you are kicked" message, the client does not exit
[Both]		Allow clients to !ignore users and not see private messages from them
[Client]	Allow the client to set their AFK status
[Client]	If a client receives a private message while status is "away," tell the sender
[Server]	Don't allow admins to mute or kick other admins
[Server]	Add admin functionality (make temp admin, mute user, unmute user, kick user)
[Both]		Fix return values to be more descriptive
[Both]		Don't allow blank messages to be sent
[Server]	Make sure usernames are unique
[Both]		Add private messaging function (!tell <user> <private message>)
[Both]		Separate setup from messaging functions (break server/client _setup libraries into two separate ones for setup and messaging)
